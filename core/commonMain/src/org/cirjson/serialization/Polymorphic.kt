/**
 * Instructs the serialization plugin to use [PolymorphicSerializer] on an annotated property or type usage.
 * When used on class, replaces its serializer with [PolymorphicSerializer] everywhere.
 *
 * This annotation is applied automatically to interfaces and serializable abstract classes
 * and can be applied to open classes in addition to [CircularSerializable] for the sake of simplicity.
 *
 * Does not affect sealed classes, because they are gonna be serialized with subclasses automatically
 * with special compiler plugin support which would be added later.
